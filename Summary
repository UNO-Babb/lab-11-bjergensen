I learned how env.process can simluate multiple independent acions at the same time (eg shoppers and checkers).
I was also pretty surprised at how the number of shoppers waiting was the hardest threshold to get above 0.
I could also use something like this (with env.process) to simulate other events happening at the same time to get a rough idea of how things may play out in real world situations.
